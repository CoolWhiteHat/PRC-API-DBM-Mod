# PRC-API-DBM-Mod

This is a custom mod created for **Discord Bot Maker** that simplifies integration with the **Police Roleplay Community (PRC) API**, designed for the **Emergency Response: Liberty County (ER:LC)** game on Roblox.  
It is especially helpful for beginners who want to connect their bot to the PRC API with minimal setup.
